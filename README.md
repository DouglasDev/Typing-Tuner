# Typing-Tuner
<h3>App for improving, rather than teaching, touch typing. The target user is someone that can already touch type but makes frequent mistakes.</h3>

<h2>How to use:</h2>

 Start by taking the test. The program will track which letters you type incorrectly the most often. Then it will generate a text containing only your worst keys for you to practice by pressing "practice worst keys".
